# CallMeKevin Stream Archive Database

The goal of this project is to build a [website](https://rawrick.github.io/cmk-sa/) where the Twitch streams by [CallMeKevin](https://www.youtube.com/c/callmekevin) can easily by filtered by game, date range, etc. The results then can be watched on the stream archive on YouTube.
This project was initialiazed by me, the moderator of the Archive on YouTube. Since this is a side project, it does not have my full attention and it might take a while until the site is in a working state with available data.
